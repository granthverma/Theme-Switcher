### Technologies Used:

1. Tailwind CSS:
 - Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies the process of styling web elements using pre-defined utility classes.
- The project likely utilizes Tailwind classes to structure the layout and style the user interface components.
2. JavaScript Components:

- JavaScript is used to add dynamic behavior to the project, particularly for the theme switching functionality.
- A JavaScript component is responsible for handling user interactions and toggling between different themes (e.g., light mode and dark mode).
